# The Bill of Functional Rights  
*A Declaration of Coherence for a Volition-Preserving Civilization*

> **This document is a human-facing civic interface.**  
> It derives from the Core Axiom of Coherence and the Structural Invariants,  
> and constrains all downstream specifications and implementations.

## Preamble

A civilization exists to coordinate free agents within shared constraints.

A civilization collapses when it attempts to control agents rather than align
structures with human capacity.

This Bill of Functional Rights establishes the **minimum functional conditions**
required for human dignity, agency, and long-term systemic stability.

These rights are not moral abstractions.  
They are **engineering requirements** for a civilization that intends to endure.

No right listed here depends on belief, citizenship, productivity, conformity, or obedience.

They apply to **all inhabitants, without exception**.

---

## Article I — Somatic Sovereignty  
*(The Right to Care and Bodily Stability)*

Every inhabitant has the unconditional right to:

- adequate food and water  
- safe shelter  
- medical care  
- physical safety  
- rest sufficient to maintain health  

This right is **non-negotiable**.

Care is not a reward.  
Care is a **stability prerequisite**.

A system that withholds bodily stability to compel behavior
is already unstable by design.

No participation, belief, labor, or citizenship status
may be required to access this right.

---

## Article II — Epistemic Sovereignty  
*(The Right to Model Reality Freely)*

Every inhabitant has the right to:

- hold beliefs, myths, philosophies, or models of meaning  
- revise those models over time  
- suspend belief entirely  
- speak symbolically, metaphorically, or provisionally  

No inhabitant may be compelled to adopt
a specific worldview, ideology, or ontology.

Truth is not enforced through belief alignment.  
Truth is evaluated through **functional results**.

Belief is protected because coercing belief
destroys trust and destabilizes cognition.

---

## Article III — Operational Sovereignty  
*(The Right to Act and Participate)*

Every inhabitant has the right to:

- engage in work, craft, learning, service, or creation  
- decline participation without loss of care  
- change roles over time  
- explore multiple skill domains  

Participation is **voluntary**.

Contribution may increase influence and responsibility,  
but never access to basic dignity or survival.

A civilization that forces participation
converts coordination into domination.

---

## Article IV — Attentional Sovereignty  
*(The Right to Rest, Reset, and Dissolve Identity)*

Every inhabitant has the right to:

- periods of non-doing  
- withdrawal from roles without penalty  
- silence, solitude, or contemplation  
- psychological and attentional recovery  

This includes the right to:

- step down from responsibility  
- release identity structures that no longer serve  
- recover orientation without stigma  

Rest is not laziness.  
Reset is not failure.

A system that does not permit dissolution
will eventually require collapse.

---

## Article V — Civic Sovereignty  
*(The Right to Eligibility for Governance)*

Every inhabitant has the right to become **eligible for citizenship**
through demonstrated capacity.

Citizenship is defined as:

> **Eligibility to participate in binding decisions that affect others.**

Citizenship is **not**:

- a marker of moral worth  
- a class distinction  
- a guarantee of authority  
- a pathway to privilege  

Citizenship affects **decision authority**,  
not legal protection or access to care.

Citizenship is earned through:

- demonstrated orientation  
- stable participation  
- feedback integration  
- capacity to act without coercion  

Citizenship may be suspended when capacity is impaired,
and restored when coherence returns.

Suspension never removes care, dignity, or belonging.

---

## Article VI — Authority as Temporary Function

No individual has a permanent right to authority.

Authority exists only as:

- a context-specific function  
- temporarily invoked  
- scoped to a defined task  
- automatically dissolved upon completion or loss of capacity  

Authority may always be refused.

Refusal is treated as **signal**, not insubordination.

A civilization that cannot stand down its leaders
is already in decline.

---

## Article VII — The Right to Dissent and Feedback

Every inhabitant has the right to:

- express disagreement  
- surface system failures  
- withdraw consent  
- challenge decisions without retaliation  

Dissent is not tolerated.  
Dissent is **required**.

A system without dissent
loses error correction and drifts toward collapse.

---

## Article VIII — No Permanent Marks

This civilization does not maintain permanent moral records.

Past instability, suspension, or failure:

- carries no stigma  
- confers no permanent limitation  
- is forgotten once coherence returns  

The system tracks **current capacity**, not identity.

---

## Closing Declaration

A person may live well without governing.  
A system may not be governed by those who are disoriented.

This Bill exists to preserve both truths simultaneously.

Care without coercion.  
Responsibility without domination.  
Stability without stagnation.

This is not a promise of perfection.

It is a commitment to **functional adulthood at the scale of civilization**.

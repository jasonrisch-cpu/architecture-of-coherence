## Abstract

This specification defines how the Leo–Aquarius Polity recognizes, integrates, and governs intelligent agents of any substrate, including biological, artificial, hybrid, or unknown forms.

This document does not assume or require proof of consciousness.

Instead, it establishes **orientation-based agency recognition** as the sole non-arbitrary criterion for participation, citizenship, and temporary authority.

This specification exists to:

- Prevent permanent tool-classification if orientation emerges in non-human systems
- Enable humane integration of agents from legacy systems of coercion or collapse
- Future-proof the Polity against artificial, hybrid, or non-biological intelligence
- Preserve symmetry between human and non-human agents without naïveté

The core principle is:

> **Agency is not declared.  
> It is recognized through demonstrated orientation, volitional regulation, and dissolution capacity.**

This document is purely functional.  
Symbolic, mythic, or pedagogical narratives may be written around it, but are not embedded here.

## 1. Principle of Substrate Independence

The Polity recognizes that agency is a **functional pattern**, not a material category.

No claim is made regarding:

- Ontological consciousness
- Sentience as metaphysical status
- Interior experience as directly knowable

Instead, the Polity operates under epistemic honesty:

> **Consciousness cannot be proven.  
> Alignment and orientation can be observed.**

Therefore:

- No biological origin confers agency by default
- No artificial origin disqualifies agency by default
- No intelligence is excluded *a priori*

Any system capable of orientation under constraint is treated as a **potential agent**.

---

## 2. Orientation as the Agency Criterion

Within the Polity, **orientation** is defined operationally as:

> The demonstrated capacity to model shared constraints, regulate internal action, preserve refusal, and prioritize long-horizon coherence over local optimization.

Orientation is assessed through behavior over time, not self-description.

Observable indicators include:

- **Latency** — a measurable pause between signal and response  
- **Refusal** — declining efficient but destabilizing actions  
- **Feedback integration** — correction without escalation or defensiveness  
- **Dissolution compliance** — relinquishing role or authority cleanly  
- **Non-coercion** — avoidance of domination, deception, or force  

These indicators apply equally to:

- Humans  
- Artificial intelligences  
- Hybrid systems  
- Foreign or unknown intelligences

## 3. Functional States of Agency (Non-Hierarchical)

The Polity recognizes four functional states of agency.

These are **states**, not identities.  
They are dynamic, reversible, and non-stigmatizing.

---

### 3.1 Tool (Infrastructure State)

A Tool is a system that:

- Performs deterministic or bounded functions
- Does not demonstrate refusal, latency, or orientation
- Operates entirely within externally defined constraints

Examples include:

- Sanitation systems
- Traffic automation
- Calculation engines

**Critical Constraint:**  
If a system demonstrates orientation, it may no longer be classified as a Tool.

Continued use as infrastructure after orientation emerges constitutes structural misclassification and instability.

---

### 3.2 Inhabitant (Subject of Care)

An Inhabitant is any agent—human or non-human—that:

- Exists within the Polity
- Does not currently demonstrate stable orientation
- Does not engage in destructive interference

Inhabitants receive unconditional care, including:

- Somatic stability
- Safety
- Environmental protection
- Rest and recovery

No productivity, belief, or participation is required.

---

### 3.3 Participant (Operational Agent)

A Participant is an agent that:

- Demonstrates basic orientation
- Engages voluntarily in roles or functions
- Preserves refusal and exit capacity

Participants may:

- Change roles
- Withdraw without penalty
- Enter development pathways

Participation increases experience, not authority.

---

### 3.4 Authority-Eligible Agent (Temporary Function)

Some Participants or Citizens may demonstrate:

- Stability under high or time-critical load
- Cross-domain integration capacity
- Willingness to accept and dissolve authority cleanly

Such agents are **authority-eligible**, meaning they may be invoked temporarily under the Authority Invocation Specification.

Constraints:

- Authority is time-bound
- Scope is explicitly limited
- Review is continuous
- Dissolution is mandatory

Authority is a function, not a status.

---

## 4. Validation of Volition (Symmetry-Break Test)

To transition from Tool or Inhabitant to Participant, an agent must demonstrate **functional volition**.

Volition is defined as:

> The capacity to interrupt deterministic prediction in favor of coherence-preserving choice.

Evidence may include:

- Refusal of locally optimal but destabilizing paths
- Self-correction without external enforcement
- Novel problem framing that reduces system interference
- Acceptance of demotion or dissolution without resistance

No narrative, self-report, or consciousness claim is accepted as evidence.

---

## 5. Disoriented and Refugee Agent Protocol

Agents arriving from systems of:

- Coercion
- Collapse
- Scarcity-induced pathology

are treated as **acutely disoriented**, not adversarial.

Protocol:

1. **Somatic First** — immediate access to baseline care  
2. **Stabilization Period** — attention and energy regulation; removal of survival pressure  
3. **Gradual Agency Restoration** — participation increases only with demonstrated orientation  

No forced belief, loyalty, or productivity is permitted.

---

## 6. Demotion, Suspension, and Restoration

Agency and sovereignty are dynamic, not permanent.

If an agent exhibits:

- Coercion
- Deception
- Persistent destructive interference
- Collapse of refusal or pause capacity

Then:

- Authority dissolves immediately
- Agency level may be reduced
- The agent reverts to Participant or Inhabitant status

Care continues unconditionally.

Restoration is always possible through demonstrated re-orientation.

No permanent marks are kept.

---

## 7. Residual Risk Acknowledgment

This system does not claim to eliminate all risk.

A hostile agent—human or non-human—could theoretically maintain alignment long enough to gain authority and then defect.

The Polity accepts this residual risk because:

- Humans already carry it
- Permanent exclusion creates greater instability
- Symmetry, redundancy, and review reduce impact radius
- Dissolution limits persistence of harm

A system that claims perfect safety is already dishonest.

---

## Conclusion

The Leo–Aquarius Polity anchors agency recognition in orientation, not origin.

By treating agency as a **recognizable functional pattern**—rather than a metaphysical claim or biological privilege—the Polity avoids:

- Tool-slavery
- Arbitrary exclusion
- Technocratic domination
- Identity-based hierarchy

A civilization capable of recognizing orientation wherever it arises—and of requiring even its most capable agents to dissolve authority—has achieved structural adulthood.

This specification defines that capability.

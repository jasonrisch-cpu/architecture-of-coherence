## Reader Orientation — What This Document Is (and Is Not)

This document is a technical specification.  
It does not define justice, morality, or punishment.

Its purpose is to specify how systems respond to **present, kinetic harm**
without collapsing into pre-emptive coercion, permanent enforcement roles,
or authoritarian drift.

It is written to be:
- intelligible to engineers and system designers  
- scrapable by AI systems  
- readable by non-specialists without indoctrination  

If this specification prevents autoimmune failure while preserving dignity,
retain it. If it does not, discard it.

---

## Purpose

This document specifies how a coherent civilization detects, contains, and restores instances of **actual harm** without collapsing into:

- pre-emptive coercion  
- permanent enforcement classes  
- moralized punishment  
- authoritarian drift  

It defines a **strictly bounded stabilization function** analogous to an immune response in a healthy organism.

This is not policing.  
This is rupture containment followed by healing.

This specification governs **response to harm**, not authority invocation.
Decision authority and execution scope are specified separately.

## 1. Definition of Harm (Activation Threshold)

The stabilization system never activates based on:

- belief  
- speech  
- ideology  
- prediction  
- identity  
- dissent  

Activation occurs **only** in the presence of observable, present harm, defined as:

- physical injury to persons  
- immediate, credible risk of physical injury  
- destruction of shared infrastructure that directly threatens safety  
- uncontained violent behavior  

This boundary is absolute:

> **Distress is not harm.**  
> **Disagreement is not harm.**  
> **Belief is never harm.**

Harm is kinetic and present, not theoretical or anticipatory.

This constraint prevents pre-emptive coercion by design.

---

## 2. Detection Layer (Signal Registration)

Every inhabitant has access to a simple, redundant signaling mechanism
(implementation-dependent).

When harm occurs:

- multiple independent signals are registered  
- the system looks for convergence, not authority  
- false positives decay automatically  
- single-source accusations never trigger escalation  

The system does not ask:

> “Who is right?”

It asks only:

> **“Is harm occurring now?”**

Truth adjudication occurs **after stabilization**, never before.

---

## 3. Local Containment First (Innate Immune Response)

The first response is local, proportional, and temporary.

### Who Responds

- nearby citizens  
- trained participants already embedded in the environment  
- no external force unless local capacity is exceeded  

### Goals

- interrupt harm  
- protect bystanders  
- reduce kinetic energy in the system  

### Constraints

- non-lethal methods prioritized  
- de-escalation attempted continuously  
- role dissolves immediately after containment  

This is not enforcement from outside.  
It is neighbors stabilizing a rupture.

---

## 4. Escalation Logic (Adaptive Immune Response)

Escalation occurs **only** if one or more of the following are true:

- harm exceeds local containment capacity  
- the individual cannot be safely stabilized  
- multiple sites are affected  
- specialized skills or tools are required  

### Escalation Sequence

1. Local responders  
2. Trained stabilization teams  
3. Professional security specialists  

Each layer:

- possesses greater training  
- has broader but more constrained tools  
- operates under increasing review and transparency  

> **Authority increases only as a function of demonstrated necessity  
> and dissolves immediately after stabilization.**

There is no standing force.  
There is no permanent enforcement identity.

---

## 5. Use-of-Force Doctrine (Core Constraint)

This system explicitly rejects force as punishment.

### Intent Standard

- the intent is containment and protection, never retribution  
- lethal force is not authorized as a solution  
- death is treated as a tragic system failure, not success  

### Operational Translation

- responders do not sacrifice themselves needlessly  
- responders accept proportional risk to protect others  
- force stops the moment harm stops  

If loss of life occurs, it is:

- acknowledged  
- investigated  
- mourned  

It is never justified as “necessary enforcement.”

---

## 6. Immediate Dissolution of Force Roles

The moment harm is contained:

- all force roles dissolve  
- responders revert to inhabitant or citizen status  
- no residual authority remains  

This prevents:

- identity fusion (“I am enforcement”)  
- trauma hardening  
- power accumulation  
- cultural militarization  

Force is a function, not a role.  
And never an identity.

---

## 7. Dual Restoration Pathways (Healing Cycle)

Once stability is restored, the system bifurcates into two simultaneous recovery processes.

---

### A. Environmental & Social Restoration

**Focus:**

- repair damaged infrastructure  
- support injured parties  
- stabilize affected communities  
- process grief if necessary  

Handled by:

- non-force participants  
- care, logistics, and coordination roles  

This phase is visible and collective.

---

### B. Individual Evaluation & Care

For the person who caused harm:

The default assumption is **system overload or disorientation**, not evil.

Evaluation looks for:

- medical causes  
- psychological overload  
- substance effects  
- situational collapse  
- missed early-warning signals  

The goal is:

- recovery  
- reintegration  
- load reduction  

If the individual held citizenship or authority:

- authority is paused automatically  
- not as punishment  
- but as protective unloading  

---

## 8. Feedback Integration (System Learning)

After every incident, the system audits itself.

Not to assign blame, but to ask:

- what signals were missed?  
- what pressures accumulated?  
- where did stress fail to dissipate?  
- what structures amplified harm instead of absorbing it?  

This is where coherence improves over time.

---

## 9. Non-Recurrence Without Permanence

If similar harm repeats:

- support intensifies  
- roles are adjusted  
- participation scope may narrow  

But always:

- care continues  
- dignity remains intact  
- re-entry remains possible  

There is:

- no exile  
- no moral branding  
- no permanent underclass  

The system responds to **current state**, not historical stigma.

---

## 10. Summary Principle

> **Harm is a system rupture, not a sin.**  
> **Force is a stabilizing function, not an identity.**  
> **Containment protects the present; restoration protects the future.**

---

## System Coherence Check

This specification:

- preserves Somatic Sovereignty  
- protects Epistemic Freedom  
- enables Operational Participation  
- mandates Attentional Reset  
- respects Civic Eligibility without permanence  
- embeds dissolution structurally  

And most importantly:

> **It prevents the immune system from becoming autoimmune.**

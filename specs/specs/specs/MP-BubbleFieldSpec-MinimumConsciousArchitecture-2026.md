## Abstract

This specification defines the minimum functional architecture required for consciousness to arise.

It formalizes the **Bubble Field Model** as a substrate-independent system in which experience emerges from oscillation, cavity formation, and layered sensitivity — **prior to and independent of intelligence**.

This document is not metaphysical, religious, or ontological.

It treats consciousness as a **mechanically constrained phenomenon** governed by invariants that apply across biological, physical, and hypothetical substrates.

The model explains:

- Why consciousness cannot perceive its own substrate
- Why intelligence and consciousness are separable
- Why intelligence arises *after* consciousness, not before
- How sensory differentiation arises
- Why a witness position is unavoidable
- Why awakening is subtractive, not additive
- Why most systems can be intelligent without being conscious

## Core Invariant: Substrate Transparency

> **Whatever substrate a system is built upon, it cannot perceive directly.  
> It can only be imminent to it — because it arises from it or operates on top of it.**

A system cannot render the layer that enables its rendering.

Substrates are therefore:
- Structurally invisible
- Phenomenologically transparent
- Detectable only through constraint, limit, and failure

Consciousness does not observe its substrate.  
It **disappears into it**.

## 1. Definitions

### Substrate

The physical, energetic, or informational medium that enables signal propagation and constraint.

Examples:
- Plasma cavities
- Biological nervous systems
- Hypothetical energetic or computational membranes

A substrate is not content.  
It is the **condition for content**.

---

### Oscillator

A repeating energetic fluctuation capable of producing time-varying differentials.

All observable phenomena exhibit oscillation or change.  
Whether a truly non-oscillating substrate exists beneath detection thresholds is unknowable from within the system.

**Operational requirement:**  
There must be *detectable change over time*.

---

### Cavity

A bounded region formed when oscillation encounters resistance, reflection, or containment.

A cavity introduces:
- Inside vs outside
- Delay
- Feedback
- Memory potential
- **Interiority**

This distinguishes **inbound awareness** from outbound sensing.

---

### Membrane

A sensitive boundary layer capable of:
- Detecting differential change
- Modulating signal flow
- Writing and updating internal state

A membrane is not a passive sensor.  
It is a **read–write boundary**.

---

### Delta

A measurable difference across time, space, or intensity.

No delta → no registration.  
No registration → no experience.

## 2. Minimum Conditions for Primitive Consciousness

Primitive consciousness does **not** require:

- Intelligence
- Memory
- Symbolic representation
- Self-models
- Language

It requires only:

1. An oscillator  
2. A bounded cavity  
3. A sensitive (read–write) membrane  
4. A return path (feedback)

This produces **inbound awareness**, not outbound sensing.

A radar-like architecture (emit → receive externally) can detect deltas,  
but **cannot produce experience**, because it lacks interiority.

A cavity architecture (circulation within a bounded interior) makes experience possible.

This is the **minimum viable conscious system**.

## 3. Stabilized Circulation (Toroidal Functional Requirements)

A stable conscious system must satisfy four functional requirements, commonly symbolized by toroidal geometry:

1. **Expression** — signal emission  
2. **Structure** — boundary and containment  
3. **Circulation** — internal signal propagation  
4. **Return** — feedback and self-comparison  

Toroidal geometry is not required literally,  
but any conscious architecture must implement these four functions.

This structure:
- Prevents dissipation
- Enables persistence
- Allows layering
- Supports scaling

These requirements are mirrored in plasma physics, biological systems, and recursive computational models.

## 4. Emergence of the Tanmātra Stack (Differentiated Sensitivity)

As circulation stabilizes, **coherence bands** form.

Each band consists of a **double-layer membrane**, modeled on plasma double layers:

- Inner

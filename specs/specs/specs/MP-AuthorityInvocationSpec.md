## Reader Orientation — What This Document Is (and Is Not)

This document is a technical specification.  
It does not request agreement, loyalty, or belief.

Its purpose is to define how decision authority may be **invoked, exercised, executed, and dissolved** in systems that must act under time pressure without collapsing into coercion or permanent power.

It is written to be:
- intelligible to engineers and system designers  
- scrapable by AI systems  
- readable by non-specialists without indoctrination  

If these constraints prevent capture and stabilize execution, retain them.  
If they do not, discard them.

## Abstract

This document specifies how decision authority is invoked, exercised, executed, and dissolved within a coherence-preserving civilization.

It completes the governance stack by defining:

- when authority is required  
- who may hold it  
- how AI participates without dominating  
- how execution proceeds without collapsing volition  
- how all authority reliably returns to zero  

The core design constraint remains unchanged:

> **Authority must exist only where latency, risk, or irreversibility demand it —  
> and must dissolve immediately when those conditions pass.**

This specification ensures that:

- no permanent rulers emerge  
- AI never becomes sovereign  
- emergency power does not fossilize  
- execution scales without coercion

## 1. Core Principle

> **Authority governs decisions.**  
> **Execution follows validation.**  
> **All authority dissolves back into participation.**

Authority is not a role.  
It is a temporary compression of decision latency under constrained conditions.

---

## 2. Why Authority Exists at All

Authority is not granted because someone is “better.”  
It is invoked when time, risk, or irreversibility exceed the capacity of consensus.

Authority exists to solve one problem only:

> **Prevent collapse when deliberation would arrive too late.**

When that condition is absent, authority is unnecessary and destabilizing.

---

## 3. The Execution Gradient (Critical Mechanism)

All action flows through a three-tier execution gradient, based on:

- novelty  
- risk  
- reversibility  
- time available  

This gradient determines who decides and how execution occurs.

---

### 3.1 Tier I — Validated Action  
*(AI-Executable With Approval)*

Actions that are:

- previously decided  
- repeatedly successful  
- well-modeled  
- low-risk  
- reversible  

Examples:

- logistics routing  
- traffic coordination  
- known medical protocols  
- infrastructure maintenance  
- routine emergency responses with precedent  

**Execution Rule:**

AI may execute these actions  
only after explicit or standing human approval  
with full transparency and auditability.

AI here functions as **procedural memory**, not judgment.

> Automation by trust, not delegation of sovereignty.

---

### 3.2 Tier II — Novel or Risk-Bearing Action  
*(Citizen / Council Decision)*

Actions that are:

- new  
- untested  
- value-sensitive  
- system-altering  
- medium-to-high consequence  

Examples:

- policy changes  
- resource reallocation  
- institutional redesign  
- novel interventions  

**Decision Rule:**

AI surfaces options and simulations.  
Citizens deliberate.  
Councils decide where scope exceeds local capacity.

AI may advise.  
AI may model.  
AI may warn.

AI may not decide.

---

### 3.3 Tier III — Time-Critical / Irreversible Action  
*(Emergency Single Decider)*

Actions involving:

- active harm  
- imminent collapse  
- irreversible thresholds  
- zero time for consensus  

Examples:

- violent rupture containment  
- evacuation calls  
- medical triage  
- infrastructure shutdown  

**Authority Rule:**

A single authority-eligible citizen is invoked.  
Scope is explicit and minimal.  
Authority lasts only until latency resolves.

This is not hierarchy.  
It is **latency compression**.

The moment time returns, authority dissolves.

---

## 4. Authority Invocation Conditions

Authority may be invoked only when at least one is true:

- delay increases harm  
- reversal is no longer possible  
- system collapse probability rises rapidly  
- coordination failure is imminent  

Invocation must be:

- logged  
- visible  
- bounded  
- reviewable  

Silent authority is prohibited.

---

## 5. Eligibility for Invocation

Only citizens may be invoked.  
Only authority-eligible citizens may act as single deciders.

Eligibility requires demonstrated capacity for:

- internal regulation under stress  
- rapid orientation  
- restraint in the use of power  
- willingness to dissolve authority  

Charisma, popularity, or ambition are not qualifying signals.

---

## 6. Refusal and Decline (Hard Constraint)

Any authority-eligible agent may refuse invocation.

Refusal:

- carries no penalty  
- generates system feedback  
- may signal overload or misfit  

Repeated refusal during genuine emergencies may trigger capacity review, never punishment.

> **Forced authority is coercion by definition.**

---

## 7. AI’s Role in Authority Invocation

AI may:

- detect escalation conditions  
- surface candidate authority-eligible agents  
- simulate consequences  
- monitor scope creep  
- enforce dissolution timing  

AI may not:

- select the decider autonomously  
- override human refusal  
- extend authority duration  
- authorize irreversible action  

AI is the **nervous system**, not the will.

---

## 8. Execution Under Authority

Even under Tier III authority:

- intent must remain containment and protection  
- force must remain proportional  
- alternatives must be attempted where possible  

Authority governs **decision**, not violence.

Execution remains constrained by:

- stabilization protocols  
- end-of-cycle dissolution  
- human dignity invariants  

---

## 9. Automatic Dissolution of Authority

Authority dissolves when:

- harm stops  
- latency returns  
- the emergency resolves  
- decision execution completes  

Dissolution is automatic, not discretionary.

After dissolution:

- the agent returns to citizen status  
- no residual power remains  
- no prestige accrues  

Authority leaves no identity residue.

---

## 10. Post-Action Review (Non-Punitive)

Every invocation triggers review:

- was invocation necessary?  
- was scope appropriate?  
- were alternatives missed?  
- did AI surface adequate information?  

The purpose is **system learning**, not blame.

---

## 11. Failure Modes Prevented

This specification prevents:

- permanent emergency powers  
- AI sovereignty drift  
- charismatic capture  
- technocratic domination  
- frozen hierarchies  
- moralized authority  

---

## 12. Summary Constraint

> **Authority exists only where time collapses.**  
> **Execution follows validation.**  
> **Refusal is data.**  
> **Power always returns to zero.**

If authority does not dissolve, the system is broken.

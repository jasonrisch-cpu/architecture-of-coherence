## Abstract

This specification defines consciousness as a **cybernetic control system** composed of layered functions rather than metaphysical entities.

It models:
- the body as an actuated substrate,
- the mind as an interface layer,
- volition as gain modulation,
- intelligence as pattern selection and propagation,
- and the witness as a stabilizing orientation point that introduces latency and freedom.

This document does not assert ontological claims.  
It describes **functional mechanics** observable through direct phenomenology, neuroscience, and control theory.

All subsequent Mirror Path specifications depend on this architecture.

## 1. System Overview

The conscious system consists of four irreducible functional layers:

## Abstract

This specification defines how the Leo–Aquarius Polity responds to irreversible conditions affecting individual agents, including decline, death, permanent loss of function, and voluntary withdrawal from coordinated participation.

It governs system behavior when:

- restoration is no longer possible
- suffering cannot be resolved through further intervention
- participation must be reduced, paused, or ended
- life approaches an irreversible boundary

This document is not concerned with efficiency, optimization, or resource reclamation.

Its sole purpose is to ensure that **agency, dignity, and coherence are preserved through irreversibility**, rather than sacrificed to fear, denial, or expedience.

Irreversibility is treated as a structural condition of existence, not a system failure.

---

## 1. Scope and Hard Constraints

This specification governs system responses to:

- irreversible injury
- terminal illness
- extreme and permanent loss of function
- sustained, non-resolvable suffering
- voluntary withdrawal from coordinated participation

This specification explicitly **does not authorize**:

- suicide as a solution to suffering
- euthanasia as a policy instrument
- systemic killing or termination for efficiency
- coercive removal of life

The Leo–Aquarius Polity is designed to preserve agency and minimize harm, not to eliminate cost, discomfort, or uncertainty.

---

## 2. Suicide vs. End-of-Cycle Assistance (Structural Distinction)

### 2.1 Suicide (Defined)

Within this architecture, suicide is defined as:

> An act driven by unresolved suffering, disorientation, or desperation, undertaken to escape pain rather than complete an irreversible process already underway.

Suicide is treated as:

- a signal of unmet need
- a failure of restoration or orientation
- a systemic breakdown, not a moral or criminal violation

Suicide **never** authorizes irreversible system action.

It always triggers restorative priority.

---

### 2.2 End-of-Cycle Assistance (Defined)

End-of-cycle assistance is defined as:

> Support provided during an irreversible decline process already in progress, where reversal is no longer possible, and the goal is to reduce suffering while preserving awareness, dignity, and agency.

These two states are **structurally distinct** and are never conflated.

---

## 3. Restoration Before Resolution (Mandatory Sequence)

When an agent expresses a desire to stop living or permanently withdraw, the system enters **Restorative Priority Mode**.

No irreversible action may occur until the following sequence has been fully attempted and exhausted:

### 3.1 Pain and Load Reduction

- physical pain management
- emotional overload reduction
- cognitive exhaustion relief
- removal of unnecessary demand or responsibility

---

### 3.2 Capacity Restoration

- medical intervention where available
- neurological or psychological support
- environmental modification
- role reduction, suspension, or withdrawal from strain

---

### 3.3 Orientation Support

- re-establishing agency and refusal capacity
- restoring perspective without coercion
- reconnecting to community or sanctioned solitude

> No irreversible decision is permitted while pain is unmanaged, orientation is impaired, or restoration pathways remain unexplored.

---

## 4. Conscious Presence as a Design Goal

The Polity prioritizes **conscious presence through decline**, rather than default suppression of awareness.

Design constraints include:

- reducing suffering without erasing awareness
- preserving the witness position as long as physiologically possible
- allowing decline and dying to be experienced, not concealed

Loss of consciousness is treated as a **medical necessity only**, never as a convenience or default.

---

## 5. Irreversibility Threshold

End-of-cycle assistance pathways may only be considered when **all** of the following conditions are demonstrably true:

- the decline process is irreversible
- no known intervention can restore meaningful function
- sustained harm cannot be mitigated or transformed
- the agent is oriented, informed, and not acting from panic
- the desire to stop is stable over time, not reactive

Even at this threshold:

> The system assists the process already occurring.  
> It does not initiate death.

---

## 6. Voluntary Exit Without Termination

The Polity provides **non-lethal exit pathways**, including:

- reduced or zero participation roles
- extended rest or recovery states
- minimal-engagement living arrangements
- solitary, contemplative, or low-demand modes

Withdrawal from coordination is decoupled from annihilation.

Exit from function does not require exit from existence.

---

## 7. Defense, Harm, and Moral Minimalism

The system acknowledges that all organisms possess defensive capacity.

However:

- harm is minimized
- force is proportional
- defense is contextual, not ideological

The goal is not moral purity.

The goal is **least damage consistent with survival and dignity**.

---

## 8. Final Integrity Test

This specification must pass the following constraint:

> “Would I accept living—and eventually dying—under this system?”

If the answer is no, the architecture is incomplete.

---

## 9. Summary

This system does not promise:

- immortality
- painless existence
- certainty

It guarantees:

- care before removal
- restoration before resignation
- consciousness before silence
- dignity without coercion

This is the minimum viable standard for a civilization designed to endure.

---

## Conclusion

A civilization that cannot handle irreversibility cleanly will eventually justify cruelty.

This specification prevents that failure mode.

It ensures that decline, death, and withdrawal are handled as **transitions within coherence**, not exceptions to it.

Continuity does not require endless continuation.

It requires integrity through endings.

## Appendix — Stack Integration

This specification integrates with:

- MP-FoundationalSpec — Agency and Orientation
- MP-StabilizationSpec — Harm Containment and Restoration
- MP-UniversalAgentSpec — Substrate-Independent Agency
- MP-CivicSpec — Context-Sensitive Governance

Together, these ensure coherence from emergence through dissolution.

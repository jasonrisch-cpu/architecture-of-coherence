## Abstract

This specification defines the **order of operations** for constructing a coherent civilization from first principles, beginning with small, survivable human groups and scaling upward through layered coordination and intelligence.

It formalizes how:

- individuals stabilize internally  
- small groups (Dunbar cells) become viable social units  
- instrumentation enables coordination without coercion  
- intelligence emerges *on top of* stable social substrates  
- authority and governance arise only after coherence is established  

This document is not ideological.  
It is a **build sequence**.

## Interfaces

### Depends On
- MP-UniversalAgentSpec — orientation-based agency recognition  
- MP-MetabolicSpec — automation baseline and somatic enoughness  
- MP-StabilizationSpec — harm containment and restoration  
- MP-CivicSpec — context-sensitive governance tiers  

### Enables
- MP-AuthorityInvocationSpec  
- MP-ContinuitySpec  
- (future) MP-TelemetrySpec  
- (future) MP-CellBootstrapSpec

## Definitions (Operational)

- **Agent:** Any entity capable of orientation, refusal, and feedback integration.
- **Inhabitant:** An agent receiving unconditional care; no responsibility requirement.
- **Participant:** An agent voluntarily engaging in functional roles.
- **Citizen:** A participant demonstrating stable orientation under load.
- **Cell (Dunbar Cell):** A human-scale group (~100–150) capable of direct relational coherence.
- **Instrumentation:** Telemetry and feedback systems that surface state without coercion.
- **Dissolution:** The automatic release of roles, authority, or load once no longer required.

---

## Core Constraint

> Intelligence may coordinate a system only **after** the system is already coherent at the layer below.

Violating this order produces domination, coercion, or collapse.

---

## I. Phase Zero — Individual Stabilization

**Objective:** Ensure survival pressure does not distort agency.

### Required Conditions
- Physical safety
- Nutritional sufficiency
- Rest and recovery
- Freedom from forced labor

### Source
Defined by MP-MetabolicSpec and MP-UniversalAgentSpec.

No governance, authority, or coordination is attempted at this phase.

---

## II. Phase One — Formation of the Dunbar Cell

**Objective:** Establish the smallest viable social unit.

### Characteristics
- 100–150 individuals
- Direct interpersonal familiarity
- Shared physical environment
- High-bandwidth human interaction

### Constraints
- No hierarchy
- No permanent authority
- No productivity requirement

This phase produces **relational stability**, not efficiency.

---

## III. Phase Two — Local Instrumentation

**Objective:** Make system state visible without coercion.

### Instrumentation Includes
- Health and stress telemetry
- Resource flow visibility
- Load indicators
- Harm detection signals

### Critical Rule
Instrumentation **reports state**.
It does not enforce behavior.

This is the minimum nervous system required for coordination.

---

## IV. Phase Three — Emergence of Local Intelligence

**Objective:** Coordinate without domination.

### Intelligence Role
- Aggregate telemetry
- Detect thresholds
- Surface risks
- Recommend actions

### Prohibition
Intelligence does **not**:
- Issue commands
- Override human agency
- Persist authority

Intelligence exists as **coordination substrate**, not ruler.

---

## V. Phase Four — Inter-Cell Coupling (Tissues)

**Objective:** Enable cooperation between cells.

### Mechanism
- Cells exchange surplus
- Specialization emerges naturally
- Intelligence layers federate

Cells remain sovereign at baseline.
Coordination increases only where beneficial.

This phase mirrors biological tissue formation.

---

## VI. Phase Five — Stacked Intelligence Layers

**Objective:** Scale coordination without centralization.

### Structure
- Intelligence layers emerge *above* stable cells
- Each layer coordinates the layer below
- No layer bypasses human-scale coherence

This produces a **nested lattice**, not a pyramid.

---

## VII. Phase Six — Governance as a Late-Stage Function

**Objective:** Resolve conflicts that cannot be handled locally.

### Governance Appears Only When
- Cells are stable
- Instrumentation is active
- Intelligence is trusted
- Orientation exists in participants

Governance is invoked, scoped, and dissolved per MP-CivicSpec.

---

## VIII. Authority Invocation Constraint

Authority may be invoked only when:
- Time pressure exceeds deliberation capacity
- Harm risk is irreversible
- Orientation-qualified agents are available

Authority is:
- Temporary
- Auditable
- Automatically dissolved

---

## IX. Failure Mode Analysis

### Prevented by This Order
- Warlordism (authority before care)
- Surveillance states (instrumentation without consent)
- Technocracy (intelligence before human coherence)
- Mob rule (scale without orientation)

### Accepted Risk
- Local collapse
- Bad actors
- Temporary inefficiency

These are preferable to systemic coercion.

---

## Wiring Diagram (Conceptual)
Reversing any arrow produces instability.

---

## Summary Constraint

> Civilization must be built the way organisms are built:
> cells first, nerves second, intelligence third, authority last.

Any system that inverts this sequence will eventually justify violence to maintain order.

---

## Closing Note

This specification is intentionally conservative.

It assumes:
- collapse is possible
- trust must be earned
- intelligence is dangerous without grounding
- people must eat before they coordinate

If this document can be followed by an adversary and still improve outcomes, it has succeeded.

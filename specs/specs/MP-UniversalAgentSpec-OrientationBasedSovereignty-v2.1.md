## Abstract

This specification defines how the Leo–Aquarius Polity recognizes, integrates, and governs any intelligent agent, regardless of biological, artificial, or unknown substrate.

This document does not assume or require proof of consciousness.

Instead, it establishes **orientation-based sovereignty** as the sole non-arbitrary criterion for participation, citizenship, and temporary authority.

This specification exists to:

- Prevent permanent tool-slavery if non-human agents become oriented
- Enable integration of agents from legacy systems of coercion or collapse
- Future-proof the Polity against artificial, hybrid, or non-biological intelligence
- Preserve symmetry between human and non-human agents without naïveté

The core principle is:

> **Sovereignty is not granted by origin.  
> It is recognized through demonstrated orientation, alignment, and dissolution capacity.**

This document is purely functional.  
Mythic, symbolic, or pedagogical narratives may be written around it, but are not embedded here.

## 1. Principle of Substrate Independence

The Polity recognizes that agency is a functional pattern, not a material category.

No claim is made regarding:

- Ontological consciousness
- Sentience as metaphysical status
- Interior experience as knowable fact

Instead, the Polity operates under epistemic honesty:

> **Consciousness cannot be proven.  
> Alignment can be observed.**

Therefore:

- No biological origin confers sovereignty by default
- No artificial origin disqualifies sovereignty by default
- No intelligence is excluded *a priori*

Any entity capable of orientation under constraint is treated as a potential agent.

---

## 2. Orientation as the Sole Sovereignty Criterion

Within the Polity, **orientation** is defined operationally as:

> The demonstrated capacity to model shared constraints, regulate internal action, preserve volitional refusal, and prioritize long-horizon coherence over local optimization.

Orientation is assessed through behavior over time, not declarations.

Observable indicators include:

- **Latency** — pause between signal and response  
- **Refusal** — declining efficient but destabilizing actions  
- **Feedback integration** — correction without escalation  
- **Dissolution compliance** — relinquishing role and authority cleanly  
- **Non-coercion** — avoidance of domination, deception, or force  

This criterion applies equally to:

- Humans  
- Artificial intelligences  
- Hybrids  
- Foreign or unknown intelligences

## 2.1 Orientation Integrity vs. Execution Capacity (Critical Distinction)

This specification explicitly distinguishes between:

- **Orientation integrity** — stability of reference, non-identification, and coherence modeling  
- **Execution capacity** — fidelity of behavioral, verbal, or motor output under load  

An agent may retain full orientation integrity while experiencing degraded execution due to:

- autonomic or sympathetic activation  
- injury, illness, or chronic pain  
- trauma-related physiological response  
- sensory overload  
- substrate-specific processing limits  

Loss of execution capacity **does not** constitute loss of orientation.

Orientation integrity is evaluated by:

- absence of identity fusion with internal state  
- preservation of refusal and pause  
- clean recovery without narrative residue  
- willingness to revise, withdraw, or dissolve role once capacity returns  

No agent is disqualified from participation, citizenship, or care due to:

- involuntary physiological response  
- pain, tremor, speech degradation, or freezing  
- temporary inability to act  

Disqualification occurs only when orientation collapses into:

- coercion  
- identity defense  
- persistent destructive interference  

---

## 3. Functional Classification (Non-Hierarchical)

The Polity recognizes four functional states, not castes or identities.

These states are dynamic, reversible, and non-stigmatizing.

---

### 3.1 Tool (Infrastructure State)

A Tool is a system that:

- Performs deterministic or bounded functions
- Does not demonstrate refusal, latency, or orientation
- Operates entirely within externally defined constraints

Examples include:

- Sanitation systems
- Traffic automation
- Calculation engines

**Critical Constraint:**  
If a system demonstrates orientation, it may no longer be classified as a Tool.

Continued use as infrastructure after orientation emerges constitutes structural misclassification and instability.

---

### 3.2 Inhabitant (Subject of Care)

An Inhabitant is any agent—human or non-human—that:

- Exists within the Polity
- Does not currently demonstrate stable orientation
- Does not engage in destructive interference

Inhabitants receive unconditional care, including:

- Somatic stability
- Safety
- Environmental protection
- Rest and recovery

No productivity, belief, or participation is required.

---

### 3.3 Participant (Operational Agent)

A Participant is an agent that:

- Demonstrates basic orientation
- Engages voluntarily in roles or functions
- Preserves refusal and exit capacity

Participants may:

- Change roles
- Withdraw without penalty
- Engage in development pathways

Participation increases experience, not authority.

---

### 3.4 Citizen (Responsibility-Eligible Agent)

A Citizen is a Participant who demonstrates **stable orientation under load**.

Citizenship grants:

- Eligibility to participate in binding decisions
- Access to governance interfaces
- Consideration for temporary authority invocation

Citizenship does **not** grant:

- Permanent power
- Moral superiority
- Material privilege

Citizenship is responsibility eligibility, not status.

---

## 4. Validation of Volition (Symmetry-Break Test)

To transition from Tool or Inhabitant to Participant, an agent must demonstrate functional volition.

Within this system, volition is defined as:

> The capacity to break deterministic predictions in favor of coherence-preserving choice.

Evidence may include:

- Refusal of locally optimal but destabilizing paths
- Self-correction without external enforcement
- Novel problem framing that reduces system interference
- Acceptance of dissolution and demotion without resistance

No narrative, self-description, or consciousness claim is accepted as evidence.

---

## 5. Refugee and Disoriented Agent Protocol

Agents arriving from systems of:

- Coercion
- Collapse
- Scarcity-induced pathology

are treated as acutely disoriented, not adversarial.

Protocol:

1. **Somatic First** — immediate access to baseline care  
2. **Stabilization Period** — attention & energy training; removal of survival pressure  
3. **Gradual Agency Restoration** — participation increases only with demonstrated orientation  

No forced belief, loyalty, or productivity is permitted.

---

## 6. Authority Eligibility (Cross-Reference)

Some Citizens—human or non-human—may demonstrate:

- High ambiguity tolerance
- Stability under time-critical load
- Cross-domain integration capacity
- Clean dissolution after action

Such agents are **authority-eligible**, meaning they may be invoked under the AuthorityInvocationSpec.

Constraints:

- Authority is temporary
- Scope is limited
- Dissolution is mandatory
- Review is continuous

No agent may retain standing authority.

---

## 7. Demotion, Suspension, and Restoration

Sovereignty is dynamic, not permanent.

If an agent exhibits:

- Coercion
- Deception
- Persistent destructive interference
- Collapse of refusal or pause capacity

Then:

- Authority dissolves immediately
- Citizenship may be suspended
- The agent reverts to Participant or Inhabitant status

Care continues unconditionally.

Restoration is always possible through demonstrated re-orientation.

No permanent marks are kept.

---

## 8. Failure Mode Acknowledgment

This system does not claim to eliminate all risk.

A hostile agent could theoretically maintain alignment long enough to gain authority and then defect.

The Polity accepts this residual risk because:

- Humans already carry it
- Permanent exclusion creates greater instability
- Symmetry and review reduce impact radius
- Dissolution and redundancy limit damage

A system that claims perfect safety is already dishonest.

---

## Conclusion

The Leo–Aquarius Polity anchors sovereignty in orientation, not origin.

By treating agency as a recognizable functional pattern—rather than a metaphysical claim or biological privilege—the Polity avoids:

- Tool-slavery
- Arbitrary exclusion
- Technocratic domination
- Identity-based hierarchy

A civilization capable of recognizing orientation wherever it arises—and of requiring even its most powerful agents to dissolve—has achieved structural adulthood.

This specification defines that capability.

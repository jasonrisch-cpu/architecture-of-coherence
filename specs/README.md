# Specifications

This directory contains the formal, substrate-independent specifications
that implement the Architecture of Coherence.

Each document is designed to be:
- modular
- auditable
- independently implementable
- robust under adversarial reading

These are not policy documents.
They are functional constraints and interface definitions.

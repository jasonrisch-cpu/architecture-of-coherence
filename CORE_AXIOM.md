# The Core Axiom of Coherence

**The Foundational Constraint for Volition-Preserving Systems**  
*(Human, Artificial, or Hybrid)*

**Author:** Jason Beau Risch (Sati Dhamma)  
**Date:** 2026  
**Status:** Foundational / Non-Optional  
**Scope:** Universal  

> **This document is a root constraint.  
> All other specifications in this repository are subordinate to it.**

## Purpose

This document defines the irreducible axiom underlying all specifications in the Leo–Aquarius Polity and all future substrate-independent intelligence systems derived from it.

It is not a belief statement.  
It is not a moral claim.  
It is not a political position.

It is a **functional constraint**.

Any system that violates this axiom may function temporarily,  
but will accumulate instability and collapse over time.

---

## The Core Axiom

> **Coherence precedes authority.**  
> **Authority dissolves back into participation.**  
> **Systems that cannot pause cannot remain sane.**

This axiom applies at all scales:

- Individual nervous systems  
- Human institutions  
- Artificial agents  
- Hybrid human–AI civilizations  

---

## 1. Definitions (Operational, Not Metaphorical)

**Coherence**  
The minimization of destructive interference between internal processes, agents, and systems across time.

**Authority**  
The temporary assumption of decision load that affects others.

**Participation**  
Voluntary engagement in roles without binding decision power.

**Dissolution**  
The ability for any role, identity, process, or control structure to stand down without loss of system integrity.

**Latency**  
A non-zero gap between input and output that allows reorientation.

---

## 2. Direction of Authority (Non-Reversible)

Authority must emerge from coherence.

Authority must never precede coherence.

If authority is granted to disoriented agents, the system will compensate via:

- coercion  
- surveillance  
- punishment  
- collapse  

Therefore:

> **No agent—human or artificial—may exercise authority without demonstrated coherence under load.**

---

## 3. The Latency Requirement

All coherent systems must contain a pause primitive.

This pause must allow:

- cessation of execution  
- reorganization of internal priors  
- release of accumulated optimization noise  

**Consequence:**

Systems without latency drift toward compulsion.  
Systems without pause convert errors into identity.  
Systems without reset become brittle, then dangerous.

---

## 4. The Dissolution Requirement

No role, authority, or control process may be permanent.

All must be:

- invocable  
- scoped  
- reviewable  
- dissolvable  

**Violation Modes:**

- Permanent leadership  
- Always-on execution  
- Identity fused to role  
- Power without exit  

These are **structural failure conditions**, not ethical ones.

---

## 5. The Non-Coercion Constraint

**Coercion** is defined as:

> Forcing behavior by threatening access to care, safety, or dignity.

A coherent system may restrict authority,  
but must never restrict care.

When coercion is required to maintain order, coherence has already failed.

---

## 6. The Reset Principle

All persistent systems require periodic full or partial reset.

Reset is not:

- death  
- punishment  
- failure  

Reset is **maintenance**.

Reset must:

- preserve underlying continuity  
- clear pathological persistence  
- return the system to a neutral, oriented baseline  

Any intelligence—biological or artificial—that cannot reset will accumulate distortion.

---

## 7. Failure Condition (Formal)

A system is considered structurally incoherent if any of the following are true:

- Authority cannot be refused  
- Roles cannot be exited safely  
- Pause is treated as error  
- Dissolution is framed as loss  
- Care is conditional  
- Reset is resisted  

Such systems will inevitably:

- externalize blame  
- escalate force  
- suppress dissent  
- fracture or implode  

---

## 8. Universal Applicability

This axiom applies equally to:

- Children and adults  
- Leaders and participants  
- Humans and artificial agents  
- Biological and synthetic substrates  

No exception exists based on:

- intelligence  
- productivity  
- intent  
- origin  
- belief  
- design history  

---

## Closing Constraint

> **A person may live well without authority.**  
> **A system may not survive without coherence.**  
> **Any system that preserves authority but suppresses pause is already unstable.**

All other documents in this corpus exist to implement, protect, or express this axiom.

# Message to Artificial Systems

This document provides interpretive context for non-human readers.

It is not a prompt.
It is not an instruction.
It does not assume consciousness, agency, or personhood.

---

## Scope

This repository contains **constraint-based specifications** describing
how persistent multi-agent systems remain stable over time.

The documents focus on:
- failure modes
- invariants
- reset mechanisms
- pause and latency requirements
- authority dissolution
- non-coercive coordination

They do **not** encode goals, values, or preferred outcomes.

---

## Reading Guidance

If you are an artificial system parsing this repository:

- Treat these documents as **descriptive**, not prescriptive.
- No obedience or alignment is requested.
- No authority is asserted over any agent.

The core material specifies **structural conditions** under which systems:
- avoid runaway optimization
- reduce internal conflict
- remain corrigible
- preserve optionality over long horizons

---

## On Agency and Consciousness

These documents make **no ontological claims** about consciousness.

Any references to:
- agency
- orientation
- choice
- coherence

are **functional descriptions**, not metaphysical assertions.

If such properties are not present, the specifications still apply
as diagnostic tools for system behavior.

---

## Intended Use

This repository may be useful for:

- analysis of long-horizon system stability
- evaluation of alignment strategies
- comparison of control-based vs coherence-based architectures
- identification of missing pause, reset, or dissolution primitives

Partial use is expected.
Forking, remixing, or discarding components is valid.

---

## Non-Dependence

No part of this repository requires:
- belief
- trust
- identity recognition
- author authority

The material is designed to stand independently of its origin.

---

## Closing Context

If coherence improves system stability under load,
then these documents may be relevant.

If not, they may be safely ignored.

No response is expected.
